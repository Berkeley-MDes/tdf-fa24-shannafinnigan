# Week 2 #
## :pushpin: 09/12/2024

I spent this past weekend navigating through the Rhino/ Grasshopper file and playing around with the inputs to see how it affected the model. I've used Fusion a little bit before, but I've never seen the workflow presented as a map in this way, so it was a bit challenging for sure. It's a less visual, more logic-based approach to modeling that I'm not used to.

I made a wooden laser-cut lantern out of plywood and cloth. I used a flower design and image traced it using Illustrator, cleaned up the spots where the design was not fitting together properly, and then measured out the lantern dimensions around this design. Here is my initial sketch and ideation for the project.

Here is the process of laser-cutting. I also took a picture of the pieces left behind after I removed my lantern- it looked super cool! I kind of wanted to reuse them for an art piece.

This was really fun. I ended up being able to get it cut exactly how I wanted on the first run-through, which was lucky. I know that some other students were having trouble with getting the laser to cut all the way through their material, with the vectors in the Illustrator file not being properly set up, etc. I'm grateful that I was able to get assistance from my classmate for this project and learn from the troubles he ran into, because it's been a while since I've used a laser cutter. I also have only ever cut arcylic, so using wood was a new experience for me. I also poked around in Rhino a bit this week, which was honestly a bit overwhelming. I have never used it before, and the last time I used a 3d modeling software (Fusion 360, for me) was several years ago. I'm excited to 3d print something down the line, though. I think there is a lot of utility in knowing how to model and print pieces and parts on your own.

## :key: Key Learnings 
In terms of learnings for this week, I'd say I have a few main things:
1. Don't plan your project timeline with the expectation of having it completed exactly how you want the first time. Build in time for extra iterations + mistakes/ unforseen circumstances.
2. Use your peers + classmates' expertise and knowledge to your advantage! Collaboration goes a long way and saves so much time when it comes to problem-solving.
3. Not everything has to be done from scratch- use the resources you have to create something cool! Finding inspiration for things that already exist is a great starting point.

## :telescope: Speculations
Here are some speculations for the future of my work based on this past week. Overall, I'm feeling really good about the way our cohort has worked together and helped each other out thus far. It's been cool to see people exchange ideas and give advice based on their own specific background, which made it super interesting to see how different disciplines started to overlap. I have a feeling we will continue to collaborate and give each other helpful insights going forward with the program. I think it would be cool to start experimenting with the emerging tools in the 3d space, such as AI to CAD and AR. Would be cool to add a digital/ interactive element to stuff we laser cut or 3d print that's unlocked and accessible from our mobile devices.
