## Week of 09/05/2024

I made a wooden laser-cut lantern out of plywood and cloth. I used a flower design and image traced it using Illustrator, cleaned up the spots where the design was not fitting together properly, and then measured out the lantern dimensions around this design. Here is my initial sketch and ideation for the project.

Here is the process of laser-cutting. I also took a picture of the pieces left behind after I removed my lantern- it looked super cool! I kind of wanted to reuse them for an art piece.

This was really fun. I ended up being able to get it cut exactly how I wanted on the first run-through, which was great. I think the burned texxture also makes it look unique and hand-made. I'm grateful that I was able to get assistance from my classmate for this project, because it's been a while since I've used a laser cutter. I also have only ever cut arcylic, so using wood was a new experience for me. I also poked around in Rhino a bit this week, which was honestly a bit overwhelming. I have never used it before, and the last time I used a 3d modeling software (Fusion 360, for me) was several years ago. I'm excited to 3d print something down the line, though. I think there is a lot of utility in knowing how to model and print pieces and parts on your own.
