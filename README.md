# Week 3 #
## :pushpin: 09/19/2024

This week, Project 1 was due! I took my experimentations and continued building upon them. I am interning full-time and had a busy so it was essential that I plan in time accordingly to work on this project, so I made sure to finish it before class on Monday so I could continue adding to it- however, I must've saved wrong and all my progress was lost! :( It was very overwhelming because I knew I had limited time to work on it. But, this is when I felt most supported by my cohort-mates! After expressing my frustrations, I was able to rebuild where I left off, and with the help of my classmates and the Design Specialists, get my project finished and printed in time!

## :key: Key Learnings 
My experimentation started with trying to replace certain parts of the system and scaling/ playing with sliders, and eventually I added in a system of my own and plugged it into what already existed in the file. 
Overall, this was a new experience for me, because Iâ€™m a very visual person and am not used to seeing visual information displayed as a system in this way, but it was a very helpful exercise to see how I could make products that could be easily manipulated and tested. I took away a couple of main things:
1. You can't do everything all the time. There will be set-backs. This is the time to lean on your peers! To open up and ask for help- there's nothing wrong with not knowing where to pick up again.
2. It's all about the process, not the end result. I feel like I learned so much more from experimenting and struggling with the software than when it all came together in the end. 

## :telescope: Speculations
I am particularly interested in how everyday activities/ rituals may be augmented by systematically designed product ecosystems- How far are we willing to integrate Artificial Intelligence in our personal spaces? Makes me think about the idea of entirely smart homes or buildings that authors have predicted in Science fiction
Overall, I see the benefit of computational design tools and systems design being in creating customized product experiences- increasing democratization, accessibility, and even sustainability.

I spent this past weekend navigating through the Rhino/ Grasshopper file and playing around with the inputs to see how it affected the model. I've used Fusion a little bit before, but I've never seen the workflow presented as a map in this way, so it was a bit challenging for sure. It's a less visual, more logic-based approach to modeling that I'm not used to. It's almost like a mindmap or concept map for the process of making a model, turning certain witches off and on, funneling certain inputs into certain fields.
My concept map trying to understand the Grasshopper diagram for the 3D printed phone stand file:

<kbd><img width="100%" alt="concept map" src="assets/Grasshopper Diagram.png"></kbd>

I also played around a bit with editing components/ shapes within the Grasshopper flow. Below, you can see the version I made of the phone case to specifically fit my phone's dimensions. I also made it thicker. Then, I changed the internal cut-out that was originally a cylinder, into a cone, so that there was more of a gradual incline to the cutout. It looks like a little gnome with a red hat :)

<kbd><img height="200" src="assets/thickness.png"></kbd> <kbd><img height="200" src="assets/cone1.png"></kbd> <kbd><img height="200" src="assets/cone2.png"></kbd>

Towards the end of the week, I experimented more with adding my own shapes, this time replacing the cylinder with a cube. I used TJ's video to follow along and make a new shape from scratch in Grasshopper, bring it into the existing Grasshopper file, and replace the cylinder section of the diagram with my own, plugging in variables where necessary. I think seeing the process from start to finish and him explaining each component as we moved along was extremely helpful to my understanding.

I didn't realize before seeing TJ go through the process that the "clusters" are actually expanded into their own separate, extra grasshopper spaghetti sections. Almost like a grouping mechanism of some sort. As such, I'd probably update my mindmap to look more like this:

<kbd><img  width="100%" src="assets/Grasshopper Diagram Updated.png"></kbd>

This time, adding a bit more detail and accounting for the fact that these clusters have their own separate logic going on behind the scenes. 

## :key: Key Learnings 
I had a couple main learnings so far for this week:
1. This is a WHOLE NEW way of understanding a design process that I typically have done in a very visual way. It is a more systematic and logic-based mode of creating models. In cases where testing must be done, and the parameters of what you're making are highly important, this is very useful.
2. Someone asked what the benefit of Grasshopper is vs. just making something directly in Rhino. In Grasshopper, you are able to directly change the parameters you use for your model. You can easily create sliders that allow you to manipulate various aspects. Additionally, it can be used to give feedback for testing purposes. In Rhino alone, this is not possible. 

## :telescope: Speculations
I think that this week had a huge learning curve overall. But it got me thinking about the future of design processes. More and more, I keep hearing about how we're headed away from designing individual products, and more towards designing SYSTEMS. This is a prime example. It is less useful to model a shape that you cannot effectively manipulate after the fact, or test to ensure that it is accomodating the specific user it is being designed for. At the end of the day, there are so many different types of users with their own separate needs- in a future where we are able to designed more customized experiences/ systems, this type of design is much needed.

I made a wooden laser-cut lantern out of plywood and cloth. I used a flower design and image traced it using Illustrator, cleaned up the spots where the design was not fitting together properly, and then measured out the lantern dimensions around this design. Here is my initial sketch and ideation for the project. 

<kbd><img alt="lantern sketch" src="assets/IMG_9226.jpg" width="400" /> </kbd>

Here is the process of laser-cutting. I also took a picture of the pieces left behind after I removed my lantern- it looked super cool! I kind of wanted to reuse them for an art piece.

This was really fun. I ended up being able to get it cut exactly how I wanted on the first run-through, which was lucky. I know that some other students were having trouble with getting the laser to cut all the way through their material, with the vectors in the Illustrator file not being properly set up, etc. I'm grateful that I was able to get assistance from my classmate for this project and learn from the troubles he ran into, because it's been a while since I've used a laser cutter. I also have only ever cut arcylic, so using wood was a new experience for me. I also poked around in Rhino a bit this week, which was honestly a bit overwhelming. I have never used it before, and the last time I used a 3d modeling software (Fusion 360, for me) was several years ago. I'm excited to 3d print something down the line, though. I think there is a lot of utility in knowing how to model and print pieces and parts on your own.

## :key: Key Learnings 
In terms of learnings for this week, I'd say I have a few main things:
1. Don't plan your project timeline with the expectation of having it completed exactly how you want the first time. Build in time for extra iterations + mistakes/ unforseen circumstances.
2. Use your peers + classmates' expertise and knowledge to your advantage! Collaboration goes a long way and saves so much time when it comes to problem-solving.
3. Not everything has to be done from scratch- use the resources you have to create something cool! Finding inspiration for things that already exist is a great starting point.

## :telescope: Speculations
Here are some speculations for the future of my work based on this past week. Overall, I'm feeling really good about the way our cohort has worked together and helped each other out thus far. It's been cool to see people exchange ideas and give advice based on their own specific background, which made it super interesting to see how different disciplines started to overlap. I have a feeling we will continue to collaborate and give each other helpful insights going forward with the program. I think it would be cool to start experimenting with the emerging tools in the 3d space, such as AI to CAD and AR. Would be cool to add a digital/ interactive element to stuff we laser cut or 3d print that's unlocked and accessible from our mobile devices.
